[ ] - implement layer shadows:
    [ ] - in render rules structure, if layer is assumed to be for "walls" or "roof":
        [ ] - ??

[ ] - make layers constant so engine could render it to a framebuffer texture once and potentialy save on instanced rendering
    [ ] - downsides - layer will be truly static - no animated blocks and no movement, you woud hav to render dynamic objects on top of it

[ ] - make resolution changeable
[ ] - make fullscreen possible
