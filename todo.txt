[ ] - implement layer shadows:
    [ ] - in render rules structure, if layer is assumed to be for "walls" or "roof":
        [ ] - ??

[ ] - add native support for particles
[x] - make resolution changeable
[x] - make fullscreen possible
[x] - add a window resolution change event and make lua respond to it by configuring the screen sizes



[ ] - level editor categories
[ ] - text writing
[ ] - brush sizes
[ ] - zooming in and out
[ ] - force place mode
[ ] - general wiki for the level editor
[x] - autotiling support, 3x3, 
    [ ] - 47 autotiling still in works
[ ] - level and layer manager

[ ] - multiplayer
    [ ] - add procedural generation for levels so only seeds of rooms needed to be exchanged
        [ ] - assign a generate function for rooms that only take the seed in
    [ ] - load a main menu room, with single player, multiplayer, settings, exit choices
        [ ] - ...
    [ ] - client has to:
        [ ] - establish an encrypted connection, with an optional password
        [ ] - accept the registry of the server on connection, also get the hash of the zip archive
        [ ] - unzip it into a server-dependant folder, save the hash for next connections
        [ ] - hash is calculated from the zip file, thats faster than doing hash from every file
        [ ] - if connected to the server, check if any of installed registry hashes matches any locally installed hashes, then use that registry instead of downloading a new one
        [ ] - from here, call the full_connected callback in Lua
            [ ] - woud require some exposed networking functions to send arbitrary data from client to server Lua interpreters
            [ ] - ask the server what rooms current client should see, get seeds and room types
            [ ] - generate those rooms based on seeds and types
            [ ] - push to a client view, start rendering and accepting inputs
            [ ] - send player buttons only and other events that the server should be aware of
            [ ] - maybe process ui changes on client side immediately without waiting for server confirmation, but store the changes on astack
            [ ] - that all is subject to Lua coding and might be changed to anything by the registry developer, can be a chat room, an RPG game, anytin
    [ ] - server has to:
        [ ] - accept encrypted connections
        [ ] - only if configured:
            [ ] - require to not be banned
            [ ] - require to be in a whitelist
            [ ] - require to not appear in a blacklist
            [ ] - require to not be in a particular IP range, aka region banning
            [ ] - require a password
            [ ] - require a username (if not configured, anonymous connections are allowed)
        [ ] - if accepted, proceed, ofc!
        [ ] - zip the local registry if didnt, get the hash, send to the client
        [ ] - if he has the registry, don send the zip
        [ ] - call the new client callback for Lua when fully connected to the server
            [ ] - lua scripts will handle everythin to spawn a new player entity or prepare data structures for it
        [ ] - expose networking functions for lua:
            [ ] - send to a particular client
            [ ] - broadcast to all clients
            [ ] - get a list of connected clients
