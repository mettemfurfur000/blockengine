[ ] - add proper logging system
[ ] - code a normal client using openGL
[ ] - add a function to convert block data from raw to readable format and back (for lua)

[ ] - big world layer update
    [ ] - allow layers to have different block id sizes:
        [ ] - basic sizes:
            1, 2, 4 bytes
        [ ] - micro sizes:
            4, 2, 1 bit(s) per block
    [ ] - allow layers to have different height and width sizes (so it could fit in a hashtable lookup function)
        [ ] - 1, 2, 4 bytes for size variable for 256, 65536, and 4294967296 blocks in total for 1 dimension
    [ ] - make general functions for block operations on layers, so its independant on id limits or world sizes
    [ ] - make it easily saveable on disk for later loading, of course
    [ ] - instead of storing block data inside of each block, store it in some sort of hashtable

    [ ] - also change registies and have each layer its own registry
    [ ] - allow multiple layers to share 1 registry, but only if they have the same id range (sizes may be different)
