# i highly recommend you

to use msys2 ecosystem on windows to build this project

you may try to use msvc for this, but i never touched this compiler before, could be a skill issue but i don care that much

so, install msys2 and update it with `pacman -Syuu`

paste this in your msys2 terminal (purple-ish one) to install all the packages you may need to build this silly project

`pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_image mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_ttf mingw-w64-x86_64-lua`

i will add more packages later for sound support and probly other stuff..

you may also need `git` to clone this repo, you can install it with `pacman -S git`. but if you already have git installed, check if you can reach it in your terminal with `git --version`, if yes, you're good to go, obviously..

# part with actual building

open mingw64 shell (blue one), naviate to blockengine project folder and run `make test`

this will build the test executable, which will run the test suite and print out the results. if you see "total success", you're good to go, i guess...

theres also other `target`s you can run, try them out

if youre failed somewhere, then, uhh, leave an issue, ill try to help you

# for guys from linux

this project should be buildable on linux, you just need a compiler, make, lua and sdl2 libraries

also all lines below this one is generated by ai

clone the repo with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mettemfurfur000/blockengine.git`

# install the following

`sudo apt install build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev liblua5.3-dev`

then navigate to the project folder and run `make test`

# for guys from macos

i have no idea how to build this on macos, but if you know how, please make a pull request
